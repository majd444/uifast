# Google OAuth Fix Guide

Based on the error message, there's a specific issue with the redirect URI. The error shows:

```
redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000 flowName=GeneralOAuthFlow
```

I've updated your GoogleAuth.jsx component to:
1. Hardcode the redirect URI to "http://localhost:3000"
2. Explicitly set the redirectUri prop in the GoogleLogin component

## To complete the fix:

1. Go to Google Cloud Console:
   - Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Go to APIs & Services â†’ Credentials
   - Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (925544733840-s0t1dqoium2g3u7flr2ua4as73o4ncsu.apps.googleusercontent.com)
   - Click on it to edit

2. Under "Authorized redirect URIs":
   - Add: http://localhost:3000
   - Make sure this exact URI is listed (without any additional path)
   - Save the changes

3. Restart your Next.js application after making these changes

## Alternative approach:
If you prefer to keep your current Google Cloud Console settings, you can revert the code changes and update your Google Cloud Console to include both:
- http://localhost:3000
- http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback

The key is ensuring that the redirect URI in your code exactly matches what's registered in Google Cloud Console.
